# The-Infrastructure-Automation-with-Ansible

# Project Overview

This project aims to automate the setup and configuration of a basic web server infrastructure using Ansible. The infrastructure includes a web server (Nginx or Apache), a database server (MySQL or PostgreSQL), and an optional load balancer.

Prerequisites
Before running the Ansible playbooks, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Ansible is installed on the control machine.
SSH access to target servers is set up.

inventories: Contains inventory files for different environments (production, staging) and group_vars for variable definitions.
roles: Organized roles for web server, database server, and load balancer.
playbooks: YAML files defining the execution flow for each component.

# Inventory Setup

Edit the inventory files under the inventories/ directory to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your target servers. Group the servers based on their roles (e.g., web servers, database servers)

# Playbook Execution

To run the playbooks, use the following command:

Replace production with staging if deploying to the staging environment.

# Customization Options

The playbooks use variables for customization. Edit the group_vars files in the inventories/ directory to customize:

webserver.yml: Variables related to the web server.
database.yml: Variables related to the database server.
loadbalancer.yml: Variables related to the load balancer (if applicable).
Example group_vars file (inventories/production/group_vars/webserver.yml):

# Testing

Before running playbooks in a production environment, test them in a safe environment. Consider using a virtual environment or staging servers.

# Security Considerations

Ensure that SSH keys are properly set up for secure communication between the control machine and target servers. Implement firewall rules and user permissions based on your security requirements.
